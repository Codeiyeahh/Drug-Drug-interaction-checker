Drug-Drug Interaction Checker
A web application to check for potential drug-drug interactions using a custom-trained Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model. This application enables users to:

Enter codes of multiple drugs.

Predict possible harmful interactions between selected drugs.

View a risk assessment and suggestions based on AI analysis.

Note: This tool is for informational purposes only and does not provide medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional before making decisions about medications.

Features
Uses a custom Feedforward Neural Network model trained on a comprehensive drug interaction dataset.

Accepts multiple drug inputs and analyzes for known or predicted interactions.

Provides interactive and easy-to-understand output (e.g., risk level, suggestions).

Responsive user interface for desktop and mobile devices.

Secure user input handling.

Technologies Used
Python (core backend logic)

Keras and PyTorch (for neural network development and training)

Flask (API and backend server)

HTML5, CSS3 (front end)

JavaScript (front end logic)


Usage
Run the Flask server locally or deploy to your preferred hosting. Access the front end via web browser, input a list of drugs, and review the analysis result for possible interactions.
